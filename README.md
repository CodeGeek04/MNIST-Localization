# MNIST
In this folder you'll find 100x100 versions of the MNIST handwriting digits dataset
where the original 28x28 image is at a random location in the 100x100

The CSV files contain the label for the image as well as the x,y co-ordinates of the bounding
boxes describing the location of the handwriting digit.

There's also a script file that you can use to create your own, tweaking the parameters as you see fit! 

After that, you can run the MNIST_Bounding_Box_Regression notebook for further localization and classification of digits
